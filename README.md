> What are variable declarations in JS?

> What are the differences between `var`, `let` and `const`?

* Some pointers:
    1. `var` and `let` create variables that can be reassigned another value.
    2. `const` creates "constant" variables that cannot be reassigned another value.
    3. developers shouldn't use `var` anymore. They should use `let` or `const` instead.
    4. if you're not going to change the value of a variable, it is good practice to use `const`.
